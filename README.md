# Dog_Vs_Cat_Classification
I am going to show you how to classify images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) deployed on the Google Colaboratory platform. You will learn the essentials of the image classification systems and the underlying computer vision concepts. After the end of this post, you will be able to create a program that learns how to detect cats, dogs and ultimately anything that is tangible.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):

CNNs are deep learning models suited for analyzing visual imagery. They are heavily influenced by how we - humans, see the surrounding world. Before we proceed to CNNs in order to analyze how computers see, letâ€™s focus on how humans are able to do it.

Image Classification - is it a cat or a dog?:

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a system that can detect cats and dogs. While our goal is very specific (cats vs dogs), ImageClassifier can detect anything that is tangible with an adequate dataset.
